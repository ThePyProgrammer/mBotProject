For rotation, you have the following variables:

|Variable|Definition|Value|
|---|---|---|
|$$r$$|The Radius of the Wheel|3 cm|
|$$l$$|The length of the chassis / distance between the two wheels|11 cm|
|$$\alpha$$|The rotation angle of the mBot|90 degrees|
|$$\theta$$|The rotation angle of the wheel|$$\theta = \frac{l\alpha}{2r}$$|
